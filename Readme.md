# Dolphin Lua Core (custom Dolphin build)

This project adds Lua support in the revision 4.0-9148 of Dolphin Emulator. This is based on Dragonbane0's Zelda Edition, which can be found [here](https://github.com/dragonbane0/dolphin).

All commits have been taken from Tales-Carvalho's fork, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Tales-Carvalho/dolphin), and adapted by me to this newer version of Dolphin.

## Running scripts

To run already implemented Lua scripts, go to `Tools` - `Lua Script`. In the new window, select the desired script (note that only Lua scripts in `Scripts` folder are shown in the list) and click on `Start` whenever you want to execute it. To stop the script execution, click on `Cancel`.

**Important**: Please note that closing the `Lua Script` window does NOT stop the script execution. You have to click on `Cancel` while the desired script is selected to do so.
