How to execute scripts:

While the game is running, go to Tools - Lua Script. In the new window, select the desired script and click on Start. When you want to stop running the script, click on Cancel.

Important: note that closing the scripts window or changing the script file does NOT stop the current script to execute! Always remember to click on Cancel when you want to make the selected script stop running.

Scripts whose filename starts with an "_" (underscore) are initiated automatically on the game boot.
